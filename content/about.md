## Projects
- **[Langchain Gemini Chatdocs](https://github.com/tunahsu/weshare)**
    - This is a Language Model (LLM) application built with LangChain + Streamlit, utilizing Google's powerful language model, Gemini Pro. The application allows users to upload multiple PDFs or web content and generate responses to their queries based on the uploaded content.
- **[Stroke- Prediction](https://github.com/tunahsu/stroke-prediction)**
    - This project integrates a 3D-CNN model for CT image classification, leveraging YOLOv5 to detect vital organ regions within the images. Uniformizing techniques are applied to standardize input image sizes. Using 3D-Grad-CAM for visualizing model attention on critical areas within the CT scans.
- **[Meter Reader](https://github.com/tunahsu/meter-reader)**
    - Reading single pointer analogue meter using object detection and image processing algorithms, including Hough transform, Edge detection, Polar coordinates mapping, etc.
- **[Facial Expression Recognition & pose estimation](https://gitlab.com/rinku1998/yuntech-csie-project)**
    - Based on the principle of CNN, we built an application to classify the expressions on face images into various categories and estimate the pose of a person from a video.
- **[Weshare](https://github.com/tunahsu/weshare)**
    - A social media site built with Django and Python,  which is similar to Instagram, allows users to edit and upload photos, as with other social networking platforms,  users can like, comment on and bookmark others' posts.
